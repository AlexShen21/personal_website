      Square
      June, 2025 – Sept, 2025
      SWE Intern
    
    
      Proxy Service & Efficiency
      At Square I was tasked with implementing a micro-service for Square's merchant email service. It served as a proxy which would subsequently fan out asynchronous requests to 4 other microservices in order to aggregate data. I implemented Redis Caching for Week over Week and Year over Year comparison data which addressed a bottleneck in latency during peak hours in which the email was triggered to send.

      Helping Devs Find Answers Faster
      At Dexcom, my goal was to create a full stack Rest API in order to automate the validation of partner application tokens in order for Dexcom Partner devs to troubleshoot buggy applications quicker. I designed the frontend with Angular and the backend was implemented in Kotlin and Springboot and the data layer included GCP datastore.

      Jun, 2023 – Aug, 2023
      SWE Research Intern
    
    
      Image Regression Research
      My internship with Argonne was the first professional experience that I had. As a freshman, I took it upon myself to learn the underlying logic behind concepts like convolutional neural networks, fine tuning parameters, and minimizing loss. I developed an image classification model as a proof of concept and consequently implemented and deployed the regression model into Argonne's Waggle Nodes in order to identify solar irradiance levels based on images of the sky.
