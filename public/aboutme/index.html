Hello, my name is Alex Shen and I am a current student pursuing my Bachelors/Masters Dual Degree in Computer Science with a concentration in Machine Learning. From a young age, I have always been interested in technology and my journey starts from my first computer science class in my junior year of high school. I remember being so fascinated by each and every concept I learned and always wanting to know what the underlying mechanisms were behind each abstraction.">

<p>Hello, my name is Alex Shen and I am a current student pursuing my Bachelors/Masters Dual Degree in Computer Science with a concentration in Machine Learning. From a young age, I have always been interested in technology and my journey starts from my first computer science class in my junior year of high school. I remember being so fascinated by each and every concept I learned and always wanting to know what the underlying mechanisms were behind each abstraction.</p>
<p>This curiosity is what has ultimately led me to pursue my undergraduate and graduate degree in Computer Science. Some of the courses that I&rsquo;ve had the pleasure of taking include Data Structures, Operating Systems, Machine Learning, Design and Analysis of Algorithms, and Online Markets. These classes have shaped the way I understand and utilize my technical ability within different specialties of Computer Science.</p>

<div class="about-fullwidth" markdown="1">
Beyond my coursework I have interned at a wide range of companies spanning from Research Labs to Industry Leaders. In my freshman year, I interned at Argonne National Lab, where I conducted an individual project, engineering a machine learning model that predicted the solar power of the sun. In my Sophomore year, I had my first taste of industry, working as a Software Developer on the Partner Development team, creating a full stack Rest API endpoint used to query for the validity of app developers. In my Junior year, I was fortunate enough to work at Square where I worked on the Food Back of House Server Team, and implemented caching as well as new modules for a Square micro-service.
<p>These experiences have ultimately led me to where I am today, pursuing a full time software engineering job while completing my graduate degree in Computer Science.</p>
