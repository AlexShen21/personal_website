Hello, my name is Alex Shen and I am a current student pursuing my Bachelors/Masters Dual Degree in Computer Science with a concentration in Machine Learning. From a young age, I have always been interested in technology and my journey starts from my first computer science class in my junior year of high school. I remember being so fascinated by each and every concept I learned and always wanting to know what the underlying mechanisms were behind each abstraction."><meta name=keywords content="blog,developer,personal"><meta name=twitter:card content="summary"><meta name=twitter:title content="Alex Shen"><meta name=twitter:description content="About Me Link to heading Hello, my name is Alex Shen and I am a current student pursuing my Bachelors/Masters Dual Degree in Computer Science with a concentration in Machine Learning.

I remember being so fascinated by each and every concept I learned and always wanting to know what the underlying mechanisms were behind each abstraction.</p><p>This curiosity is what has ultimately led me to pursue my undergraduate and graduate degree in Computer Science. Some of the courses that I&rsquo;ve had the pleasure of taking include Data Structures, Operating Systems, Machine Learning, Design and Analysis of Algorithms, and Online Markets. These classes have shaped the way I understand and utilize my technical ability within different specialties of Computer Science.</p></div><div class=about-image><img src=/images/alex_shen.jpeg alt="Alex Shen"></div></div><div class=about-fullwidth markdown=1>Beyond my coursework I have interned at a wide range of companies spanning from Research Labs to Industry Leaders. In my freshman year, I interned at Argonne National Lab, where I conducted an individual project, engineering a machine learning model that predicted the solar power of the sun. In my Sophomore year, I had my first taste of industry, working as a Software Developer on the Partner Development team, creating a full stack Rest API endpoint used to query for the validity of app developers. In my Junior year, I was fortunate enough to work at Square where I worked on the Food Back of House Server Team, and implemented caching as well as new modules for a Square micro-service.<p>These experiences have ultimately led me to where I am today, pursuing a full time software engineering job while completing my graduate degree in Computer Science.</p></div><ul></ul></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>©
