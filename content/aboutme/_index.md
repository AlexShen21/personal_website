Hello, my name is Alex Shen and I am a current student pursuing my Bachelors/Masters Dual Degree in Computer Science with a concentration in Machine Learning. From a young age, I have always been interested in technology and my journey starts from my first computer science class in my junior year of high school. I remember being so fascinated by each and every concept I learned and always wanting to know what the underlying mechanisms were behind each abstraction.

This curiosity is what has ultimately led me to pursue my undergraduate and graduate degree in Computer Science. Some of the courses that I've had the pleasure of taking include Data Structures, Operating Systems, Machine Learning, Design and Analysis of Algorithms, and Online Markets. These classes have shaped the way I understand and utilize my technical ability within different specialties of Computer Science.

Beyond my coursework I have interned at a wide range of companies spanning from Research Labs to Industry Leaders. In my freshman year, I interned at Argonne National Lab, where I conducted an individual project, engineering a machine learning model that predicted the solar power of the sun. In my Sophomore year, I had my first taste of industry, working as a Software Developer on the Partner Development team, creating a full stack Rest API endpoint used to query for the validity of app developers. In my Junior year, I was fortunate enough to work at Square where I worked on the Food Back of House Server Team, and implemented caching as well as new modules for a Square micro-service.

These experiences have ultimately led me to where I am today, pursuing a full time software engineering job while completing my graduate degree in Computer Science.
